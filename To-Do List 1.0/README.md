# To-Do List app

Followed along with a YouTube video tutorial to learn JavaScript. So far so good. 

## Issues
A couple notes for myself. Issues that I haven't investigated yet.
* On VS Code, run with debugging otherwise you get a vscode file->JSON file added to folder and webpage won't open. Have to figure that one out later.
* I still don't know JavaScript, HTML and CSS well. 
* Read above again.
* I procrastinate. Ugh.

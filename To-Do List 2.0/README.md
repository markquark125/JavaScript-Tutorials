# Create a To-Do List

Following a tutorial from YouTuber TylerPotts. Will update as needed.

## HTML code notes
* When first starting an HTML file, in VS Code and plugins, type ! and choose Emmet. Bam. Easy set-up. **Emmet** is a set of plug-ins for text editors that allow for high-speed coding and editing in HTML, XML, XSLT, and other structured code formats via content assist. 

* `<link rel="value" href="link"/>` The `rel`attribute specifies the relationship between the current document and the linked document/resource. The `href` attribute specifies the link's destination.

* The `<header>` element represents a container for introductory content or a set of navigational links.

* The `<form>` tag is used to create an HTML form for user input.

* The `<section>` tag defines a section in a document.

* Both the tags (`<div>` and `<section>`) are used in the webpage, `<section>` tag means that the content inside relates to a single theme, and `<div>` tag is used as a block part of the webpage and donâ€™t convey any particular meaning ([GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-the-difference-between-section-and-div-tags-in-html/#:~:text=Both%20the%20tags%20(,is%20called%20a%20division%20tag.)) ). 

## CSS code notes
* The `root: {}` selector matches the documents root element. In HTML, the root element is always the html element.

* `rem` stands for "root em", a unit of measure that represents the font size of the root element. This means `1rem` equals the font size of the `html` element, which for most browsers has a default value of 16px. Using rem can help ensure consistency of font sieze and spacing throughout your UI.

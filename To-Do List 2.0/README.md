# Create a To-Do List

Following a tutorial from YouTuber TylerPotts. Will update as needed.

## HTML code notes
* When first starting an HTML file, in VS Code and plugins, type ! and choose Emmet. Bam. Easy set-up. **Emmet** is a set of plug-ins for text editors that allow for high-speed coding and editing in HTML, XML, XSLT, and other structured code formats via content assist. 

* `<link rel="value" href="link"/>` The `rel`attribute specifies the relationship between the current document and the linked document/resource. The `href` attribute specifies the link's destination.

* The `<header>` element represents a container for introductory content or a set of navigational links.

* The `<form>` tag is used to create an HTML form for user input.

* The `<section>` tag defines a section in a document.~1~

~1~ Both the tags (<div> and <section>) are used in the webpage, <section> tag means that the content inside relates to a single theme, and <div> tag is used as a block part of the webpage and donâ€™t convey any particular meaning.
